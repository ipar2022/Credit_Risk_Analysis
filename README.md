# Credit_Risk_Analysis

-	Overview of the analysis
	

Lending club is a peer-to-peer lending services company.
Utilizing machine learning libraries will allow building and evaluating models for resampling. 
Two comparative machine learning models were developed to predict high and low credit risk.

- The pre column prints 0.99%
- The recall is 0.94% with a high_risk and low_risk printing very similar results. This is the the highest recall score of all of the models tested.
- F1 produced improved results compared to all of the other models at 0.97%. This is the highest F1 score of all the models tested.

- 	Summary
- 	The easy ensemble offered the highest score provided the highest recall and accuracy score.
	The data is more accurate.
